Haunted Halls is a game where you explore a haunted high school at night.
The story branches early (main entrance vs. side entrance) and splits again
(science vs. gym, keypad vs. search), creating  different mid-game
paths. Player state includes health (<=3), coins, score, and two inventory
booleans: hasFlashlight and hasKey; earlier choices unlock or block later options.
A for-loop mini-game lets you guess a keypad code in three tries to open the
library; failure costs health and success later changes the flow. Input is validated at
every prompt with while loops so the program never crashes. Endings depend on state:
a True Ending (return the key with enough light/score), a Defeat ending (health ≤ 0),
and a Secret/Alternative outcome (e.g., the janitor path or leaving unresolved).
The story map  moves: Steps → Lobby/Boiler → Science/Gym → Hall/Basement → Lab/Gym →
Library Door (keypad or search) → Library → Rooftop. A choice log and final stats print
at the end so players can see how their run unfolded.
